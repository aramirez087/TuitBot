Session 8 is complete. Here's a summary of what was delivered:

**Dual-layer idempotency** — In-memory 30s dedup (existing) + DB-backed 5-minute SHA-256 fingerprint dedup (new). Both must pass before any mutation proceeds.

**Mutation audit trail** — `mutation_audit` table with correlation IDs, params hash, status lifecycle (`pending` → `success`/`failure`/`duplicate`), rollback guidance, and timing. All 13 mutation handlers (5 in `write.rs`, 8 in `engage.rs`) wired through the audit gate.

**Rollback guidance** — Advisory metadata on every success response mapping the mutation to its undo action (e.g., `post_tweet` → `delete_tweet`, `like_tweet` → `unlike_tweet`). 14 tool mappings.

**Query tools** — `get_recent_mutations` (list with tool/status filters) and `get_mutation_detail` (lookup by correlation ID). Available in Write and Admin profiles.

**CI** — `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test` all pass (1 pre-existing flaky env-var test unrelated to changes). 22 new tests, 1828 lines added across 21 files.
