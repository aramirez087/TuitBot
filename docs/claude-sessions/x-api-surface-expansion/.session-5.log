Session 5 is complete. Here's a summary of what was delivered:

**Session 05 — Strict 4-Profile Model**

Renamed `Full`/`Workflow` → `Write`, added `Admin` as strict superset. Universal request tools (`x_get`/`x_post`/`x_put`/`x_delete`) are now admin-only. Enforcement is structural — separate server structs per profile.

| Profile | Tools | Change |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `readonly` | 14 | unchanged |
| `api-readonly` | 40 | unchanged |
| `write` (default) | 100 | renamed from `full`; universal tools removed |
| `admin` | 104 | **new** — superset of write |

**Quality gates:** All green — `cargo fmt`, 1,242 tests passed, `clippy` clean.

**24 files changed** across 5 crates + docs + scripts. Commit: `cff2e48`.
