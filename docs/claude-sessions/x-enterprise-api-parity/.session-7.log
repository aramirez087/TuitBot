## Completion Summary

### Files Created (2)
- `docs/roadmap/x-enterprise-api-parity/session-07-docs-diff-summary.md` — detailed diff summary with validation cross-checks
- `docs/roadmap/x-enterprise-api-parity/session-07-handoff.md` — handoff with merge readiness checklist

### Files Modified (8)
- `README.md` — replaced false DM/Ads unsupported claims, updated all tool counts (109→140, 104→112, 108→139, 40→45)
- `docs/mcp-reference.md` — added DM (8), Ads (16), Compliance/Stream (7) tool sections; rewrote Admin scope, API boundaries, capability matrix; updated all counts
- `docs/configuration.md` — added Enterprise API Access section (DM scopes, Ads API prerequisites, Compliance tier requirements), updated Admin profile description

- `docs/contributing.md` — updated manifest tool counts

### Tests
No Rust code changed — documentation-only session. CI checks not needed.

### Key Decisions
1. Distinguished "DM API access" (now supported) from "DM spam" (still prohibited in compliance table)
2. Distinguished "Ads campaign management tools" from "autonomous ad spend" (TuitBot doesn't autonomously create/fund campaigns)
3. Added Enterprise API Access section to configuration.md with prerequisites, scopes, and verification guidance
4. All tool counts cross-checked against `docs/generated/coverage-report.md` — 140 total, 14/45/112/139 by profile

### Warnings
- The untracked `.session-7.log` file was not committed (session log artifact, not a deliverable)
- 64 tools remain untested (pre-existing, not in scope for this initiative)
- Branch is 12 commits ahead of origin and ready for merge to main
