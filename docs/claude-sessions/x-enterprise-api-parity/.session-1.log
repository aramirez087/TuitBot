## Completion Summary

### Files Created
- `docs/roadmap/x-enterprise-api-parity/charter.md` — Decision-final implementation charter
- `docs/roadmap/x-enterprise-api-parity/coverage-gap-audit.md` — Current vs target coverage with file-path evidence
- `docs/roadmap/x-enterprise-api-parity/session-01-handoff.md` — Handoff with exact next-session inputs

### Tests Run
No Rust code was changed — no CI checks required.

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Profile model unchanged** — existing 6 profiles already capture the right permission boundaries
2. **31 new tools** as typed Layer 2 spec entries (8 DM, 16 Ads, 4 Compliance, 3 Stream Rules)
3. **Three new `ToolCategory` variants**: `DirectMessage`, `Ads`, `Compliance`
4. **`ads-api.x.com` added to host allowlist** (in Session 03)
5. **All mutations through policy gate** — automatic for Workflow-lane tools
6. **13 new mutation denylist entries** for boundary safety tests
7. **Ads API pinned to v12** — independent from v2 versioning
8. **No streaming** — only stream rule management (SSE incompatible with MCP)

### Target tool counts post-implementation
- Admin: 108 → **139** (+31)
- Write: 104 → **112** (+8 DM)
- ApiReadonly: 40 → **45** (+5 DM reads)
- Readonly: 14 (unchanged)

### Warnings for Next Session
- Session 02 (DM tools) is straightforward — no structural changes to spec pack needed
- Session 03 (Ads tools) carries the most risk — `EndpointDef` struct needs an optional `host` field added to `params.rs`, and the generator must thread it through
